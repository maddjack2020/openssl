 devices, also through whatever vendor support channels are available. If
 none of this is possible, or the problem seems to be something about the
 ENGINE API itself (ie. not necessarily specific to a particular ENGINE
 implementation) then you should mail complete details to the relevant
 OpenSSL mailing list. For a definition of "complete details", refer to
 the OpenSSL "README" file. As for which list to send it to:
 .
 - openssl-users: if you are *using* the ENGINE abstraction, either in an
 pre-compiled application or in your own application code.
 .
 - openssl-dev: if you are discussing problems with OpenSSL source code.

 Started as transliteration to "perlasm" the original code has
 undergone following changes:
 .
 - code was made position-independent;
 - rounds were folded into a loop resulting in >5x size reduction
 from 12.5KB to 2.2KB;
 - above was possible thanks to mixcolumns() modification that
 allowed to feed its output back to aesenc[last], this was
 achieved at cost of two additional inter-registers moves;
 - some instruction reordering and interleaving;
 - this module doesn't implement key setup subroutine, instead it
 relies on conversion of "conventional" key schedule as returned

 The 0 functions use the supplied structure pointer directly in the parent and
 it will be freed up when the parent is freed.
 .
 The 1 functions use a copy of the supplied structure pointer (or in some
 cases increases its link count) in the parent and so both should be freed up.

 This file has no dependencies on the rest of libssl because it is shared
 with the providers. It contains functions for low level MAC calculations.
 Responsibility for this lies with the HMAC implementation in the
 providers. However there are legacy code paths in libssl which also need to
 do this. In time those legacy code paths can be removed and this file can be
 moved out of libssl.

 Contemporary compilers implement lock-free atomic memory access
 primitives that facilitate writing "thread-opportunistic" or even real
 multi-threading low-overhead code. "Thread-opportunistic" is when
 exact result is not required, e.g. some statistics, or execution flow
 doesn't have to be unambiguous. Simplest example is lazy "constant"
 initialization when one can synchronize on variable itself, e.g.

 Example showing how to validate DSA parameters.
 .
 Proper FIPS 186-4 DSA (FFC) parameter validation requires that all
 the parameters used during parameter generation are supplied
 when doing the validation. Unfortunately saving DSA parameters as
 a PEM or DER file does not write out all required fields. Because
 of this the default provider normally only does a partial
 validation. The FIPS provider will however try to do a full
 validation. To force the default provider to use full
 validation the 'seed' that is output during generation must be

 Specific modes implementations for SPARC Architecture 2011. There
 is T4 dependency though, an ASI value that is not specified in the
 Architecture Manual. But as SPARC universe is rather monocultural,
 we imply that processor capable of executing crypto instructions
 can handle the ASI in question as well. This means that we ought to
 keep eyes open when new processors emerge...
 .
 As for above mentioned ASI. It's so called "block initializing
 store" which cancels "read" in "read-update-write" on cache lines.
 This is "cooperative" optimization, as it reduces overall pressure
 on memory interface. Benefits can't be observed/quantified with
 usual benchmarks, on the contrary you can notice that single-thread
 performance for parallelizable modes is ~1.5% worse for largest
 block sizes [though few percent better for not so long ones]. All
 this based on suggestions from David Miller.

 Some of the reports are due to sanity checks for proper nesting of comment
 delimiters and parenthesis-like symbols, e.g., on unexpected/unclosed braces.

 Here is a set of wrappers for the ENGINE API, which are no-ops when the
 ENGINE API is disabled / removed.
 We need to suppress deprecation warnings to make this work.

 This implements https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-108/final
 section 5.1 ("counter mode") and section 5.2 ("feedback mode") in both HMAC
 and CMAC.  That document does not name the KDFs it defines; the name is
 derived from
 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Key-Derivation
 .
 Note that section 5.3 ("double-pipeline mode") is not implemented, though
 it would be possible to do so in the future.
 .
 These versions all assume the counter is used.  It would be relatively
 straightforward to expose a configuration handle should the need arise.
 .
 Variable names attempt to match those of SP800-108.

 Implemented as a Perl wrapper as we want to support several different
 architectures with single file. We pick up the target based on the
 file name we are asked to generate.
 .
 It should be noted though that this perl code is nothing like
 <openssl>/crypto/perlasm/x86*. In this case perl is used pretty much
 as pre-processor to cover for platform differences in name decoration,
 linker tables, 32-/64-bit instruction sets...
 .
 As you might know there're several PowerPC ABI in use. Most notably
 Linux and AIX use different 32-bit ABIs. Good news are that these ABIs
 are similar enough to implement leaf(!) functions, which would be ABI
 neutral. And that's what you find here: ABI neutral leaf functions.
 In case you wonder what that is...

 Special method for a BIO where the other endpoint is also a BIO of this
 kind, handled by the same thread (i.e. the "peer" is actually ourselves,
 wearing a different hat). Such "BIO pairs" are mainly for using the SSL
 library with I/O interfaces for which no specific BIO method is available.

 According to NIST SP800-131A "Transitioning the use of cryptographic
 algorithms and key lengths" Generation of 1024 bit RSA keys are no longer
 allowed for signatures (Table 2) or key transport (Table 5). In the code
 below any attempt to generate 1024 bit RSA keys will result in an error (Note
 that digital signature verification can still use deprecated 1024 bit keys).
 .
 FIPS 186-4 relies on the use of the auxiliary primes p1, p2, q1 and q2 that
 must be generated before the module generates the RSA primes p and q.
 Table B.1 in FIPS 186-4 specifies RSA modulus lengths of 2048 and
 3072 bits only, the min/max total length of the auxiliary primes.
 FIPS 186-5 Table A.1 includes an additional entry for 4096 which has been
 included here.

 EME-OAEP as defined in RFC 2437 (PKCS #1 v2.0)
 .
 See Victor Shoup, "OAEP reconsidered," Nov. 2000, <URL:
 http://www.shoup.net/papers/oaep.ps.Z> for problems with the security
 proof for the original OAEP scheme, which EME-OAEP is based on. A new
 proof can be found in E. Fujisaki, T. Okamoto, D. Pointcheval, J. Stern,
 "RSA-OEAP is Still Alive!", Dec. 2000, <URL:
 http://eprint.iacr.org/2000/061/>. The new proof has stronger requirements
 for the underlying permutation: "partial-one-wayness" instead of
 one-wayness.  For the RSA function, this is an equivalent notion.

 Check to see if there is a conflict between complex.h and openssl/rsa.h.
 The former defines "I" as a macro and earlier versions of the latter use
 for function arguments.

 Will always succeed on djgpp, since its libc does not have complex.h.

 3. Patches should be as current as possible; expect to have to rebase
 often. We do not accept merge commits, you will have to remove them
 (usually by rebasing) before it will be acceptable.
 .
 4. Patches should follow our [coding style] and compile without warnings.
 Where `gcc` or `clang` is available, you should use the
 `--strict-warnings` `Configure` option.  OpenSSL compiles on many varied
 platforms: try to ensure you only use portable features.  Clean builds via
 GitHub Actions and AppVeyor are required, and they are started automatically
 whenever a PR is created or updated.
 .
 [coding style]: https://www.openssl.org/policies/technical/coding-style.html
 .
 5. When at all possible, patches should include tests. These can
 either be added to an existing test, or completely new.  Please see
 [test/README.md](test/README.md) for information on the test framework.
 .
 6. New features or changed functionality must include
 documentation. Please look at the "pod" files in doc/man[1357] for
 examples of our style. Run "make doc-nits" to make sure that your
 documentation changes are clean.
 .
 7. For user visible changes (API changes, behaviour changes, ...),
 consider adding a note in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).
 This could be a summarising description of the change, and could
 explain the grander details.
 Have a look through existing entries for inspiration.
 Please note that this is NOT simply a copy of git-log one-liners.
 Also note that security fixes get an entry in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).
 This file helps users get more in depth information of what comes
 with a specific release without having to sift through the higher
 noise ratio in git-log.
 .
 8. For larger or more important user visible changes, as well as
 security fixes, please add a line in [NEWS.md](NEWS.md).
 On exception, it might be worth adding a multi-line entry (such as
 the entry that announces all the types that became opaque with
 OpenSSL 1.1.0).
 This file helps users get a very quick summary of what comes with a
 specific release, to see if an upgrade is worth the effort.
 .
 9. Guidelines how to integrate error output of new crypto library modules
 can be found in [crypto/err/README.md](crypto/err/README.md).

       source, and configuration files.
 .
       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
       and conversions to other media types.
 .
       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 .
       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 .
       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 .
       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 .
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
       meet the following conditions:
 .
       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 .
       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files; and
 .
       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and
 .
       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
           as modifying the License.
 .
       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.
 .
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 .
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 .
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 .
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
